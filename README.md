# DevOps-Projects

This repository is for my solutions to DevOps Projects with Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced level.
You can also submit a project idea if you have one that is not on the platform.
It is a community-driven platform and gives access to a lot of projects

## Project Structure
Each project has its own directory properly named, and has a READme for instructions and the actual script.

The projects are available at https://roadmap.sh
