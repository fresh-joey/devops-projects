# Log Archive Tool

## Description

- The Log Archive Tool is a shell script designed to archive log files from a specified directory. This tool helps manage log files by compressing and moving them to an archive directory, thus saving disk space and organising the log directory.
- The script takes 2 inputs: the directory to be archived and the directory where the archive is to be stored.
