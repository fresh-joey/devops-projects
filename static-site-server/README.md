# Static Site Server

## Project details

- Setup a remote server
- Make sure that you can connect to your server using SSH.
- Install and configure nginx to serve a static site.
- Create a simple webpage with basic HTML, CSS and image files.
- Use rsync to update a remote server with a local static site.
- If you have a domain name, point it to your server and serve your static site from there. Alternatively, set up your nginx server to serve the static site from the serverâ€™s IP address.

### Step 1 - Setup a remote Ubuntu server on AWS

- Log in to AWS console
- Search for EC2 in the services tab
- Click on Launch Instance button
- Input a desired name for the server
- Next, choose a suitable linux image to use. I used Ubuntu.
- Selcet Instance type. `shell t2.micro` is fine

### Step 2 - Install and configure Nginx

### Step 3 - Prepare static files

### Step 4 - Sync the files with the remote server using rsync
